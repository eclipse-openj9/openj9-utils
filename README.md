Welcome to the Eclipse OpenJ9 Utils repository
========================================

This repo is intended as an interim home for utilities that are still finding their place in the OpenJ9 ecosystem.  This repo provides a place for groups to collaborate around the tools & utilities and to grow communities around them.

Though some utilites may eventually be merged into the main #eclipse/openj9 repository as part of the regular OpenJ9 builds, not all utils are expected to do that.  Some may live forever here as useful utils for debugging, experimenting, etc with the OpenJ9 and the broader Java ecosystem.

Expectations
============
Each util is expected to live in its own directory and to be buildable at all times.
Libraries needed by the utilities should be fetched and not checked into this repo.

Contributions
============
See To get started, read our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the main OpenJ9 repo.
